### <ins>*Cost Estimation*</ins>
 
Since this is an organic project, we’ll take the respective values for the coeffecients. 

Lines of code (LOC) = 2051
Thus, KLOC = 2051 / 1000 = 2.051 
Taking the values of the coefficients as: 

|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|ab|bb|cb|db|
|2.4|1.05|2.5|0.38 |

<br>

 
1. Effort Applied (E) = ab(KLOC)bb [ man-months ] 
 >
	= 2.4(2.051)1.05 
	= 2.4 x 2.126
    = 5.102 [man-months] 
 
2.	Development Time (D) = cb (Effort Applied)d [months] 
>
	= 2.5(5.102)0.38 
    = 2.5 x 1.857 
    = 4.644 [months] 

3.	People Required (P) = Effort Applied / Development Time [count] 
 >
    = 5.102 / 4.644 
    =1.099  
    ≈ 1
